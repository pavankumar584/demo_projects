It performs input validation to ensure that the entered value is a positive number.
Based on the number of units consumed, the code calculates the electricity bill using a slab system:

For the first 100 units, the rate is 1.5 rupees per unit.
For units between 101 and 200, the rate is 2.5 rupees per unit.
For units between 201 and 300, the rate is 4 rupees per unit.
For units between 301 and 350, the rate is 5 rupees per unit.
For units above 350, there is a fixed charge of 1500 rupees.


In addition to the consumption charge, there is a fixed charge (25, 50, 75, or 100 rupees) based on the number of units consumed.
The code calculates the total bill by adding the consumption charge and the fixed charge.
Finally, it displays the total electricity bill amount to the user.

In summary, this code automates the calculation of electricity bills based on a predefined slab system, taking into account both the
number of units consumed and fixed charges. It provides a convenient way to determine the electricity bill amount without manually performing 
the calculations.
