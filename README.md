#Password Generator

Explanation of the Code:

The code starts by defining three lists: alphabete, number, and special_charecter. These lists contain the characters that can be included in the password.
The user is prompted to enter the desired number of alphabetic characters, numeric characters, and special characters they want in their password.
An empty list called password_list is created to store the characters that will make up the password.
Three nested loops are used to randomly select characters from the respective lists and append them to the password_list.
The first loop selects random alphabetic characters and appends them to password_list.
The second loop selects random numeric characters, converts them to strings, and appends them to password_list.
The third loop selects random special characters and appends them to password_list.
The random.shuffle(password_list) function is called to randomize the order of the characters in the password_list.
The password variable is created by joining all the characters in the password_list into a single string using the join() method.
Finally, the generated password is printed to the console using an f-string.
